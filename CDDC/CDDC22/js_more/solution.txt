The file was obfuscated at first, after beautifying it I just went through the file and changed variable and function names to get a better understanding.
I later realized that all that was interesting was in the decode function, it was an interval that did an computation each 6^4 ms, and what it finally did was to 
create a js-element in the middle of the screen. By changing the interval rate to each 1ms it soon revealed the flag.
