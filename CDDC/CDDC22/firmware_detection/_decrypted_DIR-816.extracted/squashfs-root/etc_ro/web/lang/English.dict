helpsetup_024=, The main parameters are as follows:
helpsetup_025=IP Pool  
helpsetup_026=Your router uses 192.168.1.1 for the IP address. You've assigned a computer that you want to designate as a Web server with a static IP address of 192.168.1.3. You've assigned another computer that you want to designate as an FTP server with a static IP address of 192.168.1.4. Therefore the starting IP address for your DHCP IP address range needs to be 192.168.1.5 or greater. 
helpsetup_027=Your router has a default static IP address 192.168.0.1, so the address range of the DHCP server can be used for distribution of 192.168.0.2-192.168.0.254.
helpsetup_028=Example: 
helpsetup_029=Your router uses 192.168.1.1 for the IP address. You've assigned a computer that you want to designate as a Web server with a static IP address of 192.168.1.3. You've assigned another computer that you want to designate as an FTP server with a static IP address of 192.168.1.4. Therefore the starting IP address for your DHCP IP address range needs to be 192.168.1.5 or greater. 
helpsetup_030=Example: 
helpsetup_031=Suppose you configure the DHCP Server to manage addresses From 192.168.1.100 To 192.168.1.199. This means that 192.168.1.3 to 192.168.1.99 and 192.168.1.200 to 192.168.1.254 are NOT managed by the DHCP Server. Computers or devices that use addresses from these ranges are to be manually configured. 
helpsetup_032=Default Gateway 
helpsetup_033=The default gateway for the dhcp server scope. 
helpsetup_034=Max Lease Time 
helpsetup_035=The amount of time that a computer may have an IP address before it is required to renew the lease. The lease functions just as a lease on an apartment would. The initial lease designates the amount of time before the lease expires. If the tenant wishes to retain the address when the lease is expired then a new lease is established. If the lease expires and the address is no longer needed then another tenant may use the address. 
helpsetup_036=Domain Name 
helpsetup_037=Domain name for the dhcp server scope. 
helpsetup_038=DNS Servers 
helpsetup_039=DNS Server address for the dhcp server scope.

helpsetup_042=IP Address

helpsetup_044=Mac Address 
helpsetup_045=LAN access device's MAC address.
helpsetup_046=MAC Access Control
helpsetup_047=You can set a MAC address white list access on the specified interface. On those interfaces you specify only those MAC addresses in the whitelist computers, laptops and other network devices before they can access.

helpsetup_050=Internet Setup
helpsetup_051=Manually configure access parameters. 
helpsetup_100=IPv6 Address Range (DHCPv6)
helpsetup_101=
helpsetup_102=It is possible for a computer or device that is manually configured to have an IPv6 address that does reside within this range. 
helpsetup_103=IPv6 Address Lifetime
helpsetup_104=The amount of time that a computer may have an IPv6 address before it is required to renew the lease.
helpsetup_105=PPTP 
helpsetup_106=This page is used to configure parameters of VPN PPTP.Here you can change the settings or view some information of VPN PPTP.
helpsetup_107=L2TP 
helpsetup_108=This page is used to configure the parameters for your l2tp access.
