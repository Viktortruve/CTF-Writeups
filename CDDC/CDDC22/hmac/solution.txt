Were given a pdf over an encryption schema, it was quite ez to follow. Some hiccups on how the AES-CTR mode was calculated. Wrote all in a python script to create AES-Cipher.
When that was created we could decrypt chal.enc and use the password created from the secret passphrase to open the zip file.
